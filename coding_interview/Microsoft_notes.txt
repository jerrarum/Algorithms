PROBLEMS NOTE
(c) Duong Nguyen

I. Linked-list
1. Merge sorted two linked-list (MS Round 1 2013)
* Recursive solution: clean & nice solution

2. Two pointers with different speed
+ Find middle of a linked list
+ Convert from a1->a2->...->an->b1->b2->...->bn to a1->b1->a2->b2->....->an->bn
+ Find start point of loop in a linked-list (really nice problem)

o->o->o->o->o
		^	|
		|	V
		o<- o

3. How to remove a node in linked-list, given only ref to that node
4. Remove duplicate nodes in linked-list w/w.o extra memory
+ With extra memory: use, for example hastable to store element of linked-list and check if duplicates happen
+ Without extra memory: O(n^2)

II. RMQ & LCA
III. Stack & Queue & Heap (Priority queue)
IV. Geometry problems
Check if two rectangles overlap each other? (MS Round 1 2013)
